Deebee (Beta)
============
Deebee is a wrapper for Dropbox iOS SDK 1.3. It has a behaviour similar to Dropbox Desktop client's.  

It's still a work in progress, and I'm constantly refining it and testing its parts, but it may have major bugs and problems and I do not guarantee that it will work out of the box with your app. Yet.  
Moreover I'm a designer, not a programmer, so please, if you believe there's something wrong, or some bad practice let me know. I'd really appreciate your help.  
This version has a major problem with queuing downloads, or operations in general. I already have a solution, and it's coming asap.  
  
Special thanks to Chris Hulbert, who helped me to get started with [his CHBgDropboxSync](https://github.com/chrishulbert/CHBgDropboxSync).
